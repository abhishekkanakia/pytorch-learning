# PyTorch Learning

My notes, notebooks, and experiments while learning PyTorch.

## Structure
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks
- `scripts/` — training/eval scripts
- `experiments/` — logs, results
- `data/` — datasets (not included in repo)
- `models/` — saved model checkpoints (not committed)

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
